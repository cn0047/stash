     * This solution is provide as an example to you of several query
     * language features that are valuable in update operations.
     * This method adds the item document passed in the item parameter to the

     * cart already contains items or is empty. addItem will be called only
     * if the cart does not already contain the item. The route handler:
     * router.post("/user/:userId/cart/items/:itemId"...
     * handles this. Please review how that method works to have a complete
     * understanding of how addItem is used.
     *
     * NOTE: One may use either updateOne() or findOneAndUpdate() to
     * write this method. We did not discuss findOneAndUpdate() in class,
     * but it provides a very straightforward way of solving this problem.
