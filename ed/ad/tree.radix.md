Radix tree
-

[Trie](https://monosnap.com/file/1sTq5fwBiVEvPWakJiGusGK7foFmji)
(digital or radix or prefix tree) - is an ordered tree data structure
that is used to **store a dynamic set or associative array** where the keys are usually strings.

Radix tree - each node that is the only child is merged with its parent.
This makes radix trees much more efficient for small sets
(especially if the strings are long) and for sets of strings
that share long prefixes.
