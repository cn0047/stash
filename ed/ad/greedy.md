Greedy algorithm - solving optimization problems.

* Greedy method.
* Dynamic programming.
* ...

## Dynamic programming

DP helps to optimize solution O(2^n) -> O(n^2), sometimes O(n^2) -> O(n).

Properties:
* Optimal substructure.
* Overlapping subproblems (like fibonacci).

Problems:
* Combinatoric (answers question how many).
* Optimization (max or min value).

Steps for solution:
* Define objective function.
* Identify base cases
  (think about smallest dataset, like: array with 1 element or matrix 1x1 or etc.).
* Transition function (recurrence relation).
* Order of computation.
* Location of the answer.
