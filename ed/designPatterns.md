Design Patterns
-

Design patterns offer a common solution for a common problem in the form of classes working together.

1. Creational.

    * abstractFactory (in php)

    * builder (constructor)
    * factoryMethod
    * prototype
    * singleton

    * module (in js)

2. Structural.

    * adapter
    * bridge - decouple an abstraction from its implementation
    * composite - "compose" objects into tree structures
    * decorator - dynamically allows behavior to be added to object
    * facade - object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code
    * flyweight - lazy load
    * proxy

3. Behaviour.

    * chainOfResponsibility - each object contains logic and link to the next
    * command - object encapsulate all information needed to call a method
    * dependencyInjection - IoC
    * interpreter
    * iterator - used to traverse a container
    * mediator - object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact
    * memento - provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state
    * observer (publish-subscribe)
    * state - encapsulate varying behavior based on an object's state
    * strategy - behavior to be selected at runtime
    * templateMethod
    * visitor
