Data structures
-

Container - is a class, a data structure, or an abstract data type (ADT)
whose instances are collections of other objects. In other words, container store objects in an organized way.

Collection - is a grouping of some variable number of data items (possibly zero)
that have some shared significance to the problem being solved (Generally, the data items will be of the same type).

Associative array, map, symbol table, or dictionary - is an abstract data type
composed of a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears just once in the collection.

Multimap generalizes an associative array by allowing multiple values to be associated with a single key.

Bidirectional map - is a related abstract data type in which the bindings operate in both directions:
each value must be associated with a unique key,
and a second lookup operation takes a value as argument and looks up the key associated with that value.
