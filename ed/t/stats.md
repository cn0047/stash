Metric summaries:
* Count or n — count the number of observations in a specific time interval.
* Sum —  sum (addtogether) values from all observations in a specific time interval.
* Average — the mean of all values in a specific time interval.
* Median — dead center of our values: exactly 50% of values are below it, and 50% are above it.
* Percentiles — the values below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall.
* Standard deviation — deviation from the mean in the distribution of our metrics.
  This measures the variation in a data set.
  A standard deviation of 0 means the distribution is equal to the mean of the data.
  Higher deviations mean the data is spread out over a range of values.
* Rates of change — rates of change representations show the degree of change between data in a time series.
* Frequency distribution and histograms - frequency distribution of a data set.
  Group data together - a process which is called "binning" — and present the groups in a such a way
  that their relative sizes are visualized.
  The most common visualization of a frequency distribution is a histogram.
