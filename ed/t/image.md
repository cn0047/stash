Raster image - rectangular grid of pixels.
Vector image - images that are defined in terms of 2D points.

**RGB** is an additive color model in which red, green, and blue light are added together
in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors.

Additive color - is a property of a color model that predicts the appearance of colors
made by coincident component lights, i.e. the perceived color can be predicted
by summing the numeric representations of the component colors.

**CMY** is a subtractive color model
that predicts the appearance of cyan, magenta and yellow dyes or pigments
organized as thin overlaid layers to reproduce a broad array of colors.

**CMYK** is a subtractive color model, based on the CMY color model,
used in color printing, and is also used to describe the printing process itself.

**YUV** is a color encoding system typically used as part of a color image pipeline.
The YUV model defines a color space in terms of one luma component (Y)
and two chrominance components, called U (blue projection) and V (red projection) respectively.

**Image/video pipeline** is the set of components commonly used between an image source
(such as a camera, a scanner, or the rendering engine in a computer game),
and an image renderer (such as television set, computer screen, computer printer or cinema screen)
or for performing any intermediate digital image processing
consisting of two or more separate processing blocks.

**WebP** need less memory than PNG.
