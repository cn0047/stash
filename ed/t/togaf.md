TOGAF - architectural framework.

Enterprise Architecture:
* Discipline.
* Process (create -> evolve -> change -> manage architecture).
* Work products (roadmap, org chart, matrices, etc.).

Business driver - resource, process or condition that is vital for continued success and growth of business.
Business goal - high-level statement of intent, direction, or desired end state.
Business objective - actionable items needed to achieve business goals.
Business value - generated value like concrete products or services.
Business capability - people, processes, technology.

Stakeholder - individual, group, or organization who may affect, be affected by or perceive itself
to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project.

Requirements:
* business requirements.
* stakeholder requirements.
* transition requirements (migration).

Solution requirements:
* Functional requirements.
* Non-functional requirements.

Architect Focus:
* business drivers, goals, objectives;
* stakeholders, business processes, requirements;

RAID - Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies.

RACI - Responsible (who do work), Accountable (sign off), Consulted (consultant or counsel), Informed.

#### ADM (Architecture development method):

**Preliminary Phase**.
What needs to be done? How will it be carried out?

**Phase A**: Architecture Vision.
Identify stakeholders.
Confirm business goals, drivers & constraints.
And more...

**Phase B**: Business Architecture.
Focus on business.
Focus on data, application, technology.

**Phase C**: Information Systems Architectures.
Focus on information.
Focus on data, application.
Select models, viewpoints, tools.

**Phase D**: Technology Architecture.
Focus on technology.
Focus on performance, maintainablility, latency, availability.

**Phase E**: Opportunities & Solutions.
Focus on work packages.
Focus on implementation & migration plan.

**Phase F**: Migration Planning.
Finalize detailed plan.

**Phase G**: Implementation Governance.
Provide architectural oversight of implementation.

**Phase H**: Architecture Change Management.
Make sure the architecture achieves intended business value.
Work on possible simplification change, incremental change, re-architecting change.

**Requirements Management**.
Central to ADM, connected to other phases.
Requirements to: identify, store, feed in, feed out to other phases.

* Guidelines.
* Templates.
* Checklists.
* Techniques.
