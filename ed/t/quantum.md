Quantum computing
-

Quantum computer - computer that takes advantage of quantum mechanical phenomena.
Qubit - basic unit of quantum information.

Quantum supremacy - the goal of demonstrating that a programmable quantum computer can solve a problem,
that no classical computer can solve in any feasible amount of time.

Quantum decoherence - the loss of quantum coherence,
the process in which system's behaviour changes
from that which can be explained by quantum mechanics
to that which can be explained by classical mechanics.
