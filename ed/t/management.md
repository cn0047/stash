Tuckman's stages of team development:
* forming - members are on their best behavior but are generally anxious and uncertain.
* storming - (most critical) conflict arises over working styles, team asks about project goals, leader’s authority.
* norming - team starts to appreciate each other's strengths.
* performing - team autonomous, high-functioning, and focused on the goal.
* adjourning - (farewell) project ends, team disbands.
