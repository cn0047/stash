MRU - Most Recently Used

## OS Cache

OS Cache may be hardware or software.

Cache memory (aka CPU memory) is high-speed Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)
usually part of the CPU.

CPU Cache:
1) Level 1 Cache - (primary cache) relatively small (64K cache),
   built on the microprocessor chip.
2) Level 2 cache - (secondary cache) embedded on the CPU
   or on a separate chip or coprocessor.
3) Level 3 cache - (specialized memory).
4) Level 4 cache - accessed and shared by the CPU and GPU.

CPU Cache can be instruction cache or data cache.

GPU Cache.

Disk Cache - usually included as part of the hard disk.
A disk cache can also be a specified portion of random access memory (RAM).

WEB cache (browser cache, DNS cache).
