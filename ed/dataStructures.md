#### Abstract

Container - is a class, a data structure, or an abstract data type (ADT)
whose instances are collections of other objects. In other words, container store objects in an organized way.

Collection - is a grouping of some variable number of data items (possibly zero)
that have some shared significance to the problem being solved (Generally, the data items will be of the same type).

Associative array, map, symbol table, or dictionary - is an abstract data type
composed of a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears just once in the collection.

Multimap generalizes an associative array by allowing multiple values to be associated with a single key.

Bidirectional map - is a related abstract data type in which the bindings operate in both directions:
each value must be associated with a unique key,
and a second lookup operation takes a value as argument and looks up the key associated with that value.

List - ordered sequence of values, where the same value may occur more than once.
Lists are a basic example of containers.

Stack - is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements,
with two principal operations: push and pop. (LIFO).

Queue - is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order.
(FIFO).

Double-ended queue - (often abbreviated to deque) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue,
for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail).
(also often called a head-tail linked list).

Priority queue - is an abstract data type which is like a regular queue or stack data structure,
but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it.

Double-ended priority queue - is a data structure similar to a priority queue,
but allows for efficient removal of both the maximum and minimum.

Set - is an abstract data type that can store certain values,
without any particular order, and no repeated values.

Multiset (or bag) - is similar to a set but allows repeated ("equal") values (duplicates).

Disjoint-set (union–find or merge–find) - is a data structure
that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (nonoverlapping) subsets.

#### Arrays

Bit array (bitmap, bitset, bit string, or bit vector) - is an array data structure that compactly stores bits.
Is effective at exploiting bit-level parallelism in hardware to perform operations quickly.

Circular buffer (circular queue, cyclic buffer or ring buffer) -  is a data structure
that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.

Dynamic array (growable array, resizable array, dynamic table, mutable array, or array list) -
is a random access, variable-size list data structure that allows elements to be added or removed.

Hash table (hash map) - is a data structure
used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function
to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
The average cost for each lookup is independent of the number of elements stored in the table.
Many hash table designs also allow arbitrary insertions and deletions of key-value pairs.
Widely used in many kinds of computer software,
particularly for associative arrays, database indexing, caches, and sets.
