This is my tiny project created for exhibition purposes.
<br>Here I used fancy front-end technologies like: `react`, `react-router`, `redux` and `aws`...

This project is a social network.

Right now I've implemented only feed page + some really necessary stuff,
but I truly believe that it's enough to understand my idea, vision, and approach.
