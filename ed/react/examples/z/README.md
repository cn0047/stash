This is my tiny project created for exhibition purposes.
<br>Here I used fancy front-end technologies like: `react`, `react-router`, `redux`, `aws` and else.

This project is a social network.
<br>Right now I've implemented only feed page + some really necessary stuff,
<br>but I truly believe that it's enough to understand my idea, vision, and approach.
