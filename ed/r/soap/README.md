SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol
-

SOAP uses XML to structure messages for exchanging information between different systems.

WSDL (Web Service Description Language) - XML based, human & machine readable language
used to describe web service (methods, request, response, possible faults, communication/security requirements).

Pros: defined schema.
Cons: hart to support schema (simultaneously for server & all clients), XML is verbose.
