Web Application Security Risks:

#### A1 Injection

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Occur when:
data enters through an untrusted source;
dynamic content dynamic content validation.

Categories: stored (database) and reflected (response includes some malicious input).

````
<b onmouseover=alert('Wufff!')>click me!</b>
<img src="http://url.to.file.which/not.exist" onerror=alert(document.cookie);>

<? php
print "Not found: " . urldecode($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]);
// http://testsite.test/<script>alert("TEST");</script>
?>
````

FIX: Filter input escape output.

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

AIM: Force end user to execute unwanted actions (submitting a malicious request)
on a web application in which they're currently authenticated.
Perform action on the victim's behalf.

````
<a href="http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=MARIA&amount=100000">View my Pictures!</a>

<form action="http://bank.com/transfer.do" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="acct" value="MARIA"/>
<input type="hidden" name="amount" value="100000"/>
<input type="submit" value="View my pictures"/>
</form>
````

#### Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

#### Clickjacking (UI redress attack)

The hacker can only send a single click.

For example, imagine an attacker who builds a web site that has a button on it that says "click here for a free iPod".
However, on top of that web page, the attacker has loaded an iframe with your mail account,
and lined up exactly the "delete all messages" button directly on top of the "free iPod" button.

FIX: Header `X-Frame-Options: DENY`.

#### Directory (path) traversal attack

AKA: ../ (dot dot slash) attack.
AIM: gain unauthorized access to the file system.

It is exploiting insufficient security validation / sanitization of user-supplied input file names.

````php
<?php
$template = 'red.php';
if (isset($_COOKIE['TEMPLATE']))
   $template = $_COOKIE['TEMPLATE'];
include ("/home/users/phpguru/templates/" . $template);
````
````
Cookie: TEMPLATE=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
````

FIX: Query string is usually URI decoded before use.
