SOA - Service Oriented Architecture
-

Uses service bus.

SOA is less about how to modularize an application,
and more about how to compose an application by integration
of distributed, separately-maintained and deployed software components.

In SOA, services use protocols that describe how they pass
and parse messages using description metadata.

Each SOA building block can be:

* Service provider
* Service broker
* Service requester/consumer
