AVL
-

AVL tree - (since 1962) the **heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one**.
Are faster than red–black trees because they are more rigidly balanced.
Similar to red–black trees, AVL trees are height-balanced.

Balance factor: +1, 0, -1

LL | RR rotations.

Height h = log N
Worst time complexity for search = h = O(h) = log N
