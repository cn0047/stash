Tree
-

Balancing tree:

* Right rotation (when tree is left heavy)
* Left rotation (when tree is right heavy)
* Right-Left rotation
* Left-Right rotation

Update segment tree - O(log N).
Update range tree - O(log N).

Select from range array (tree) - O(1).
Update range array (tree) - O(N).

Segment tree - better for many updates.
Range array (tree) - better for many reads.

Diameter of a Binary Tree - longest path of tree between 2 leafs.

2 trees are isomorphic - if subtrees are isomorphic to each other.

Height of BT = 1 + numbers of edges on the longest path from root to leaf.

Delete a Binary Tree = Postorder + function free()

## AVL

Balance factor: +1, 0, -1

LL | RR rotations.

Height h = log N
Worst time complexity for search = h = O(h) = log N

## Radix tree

Used to store a set of strings...
