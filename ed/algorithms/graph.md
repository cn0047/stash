Graph
-

Graph - it's mathematical structure used to model pairwise relations between objects.
Graph - it's just dots and lines connecting them.
Multigraph - point connected with itself (has loopback).

Vertices - points.
Edges - lines.
Cardinality - count of vertices.
Degree or valency of a vertex is the number of edges that connect to it.

## Path

Simple path - only use every edge at most once.

Euler circuit - path has same initial and terminal veritces.
Also all vertex have even degree.

Euler path - includes exactly once all the edges and has different first and last veritces.
Also all vertex have even degree but 2 have odd degree.

## Search
