OAuth2
-

OpenID needed to understand who user is.

OAuth2 it's about delegated authorization.
It's simplified version of OAuth.

OAuth2 - is not protocol, because big companies (google, facebook, etc) made own changes that's why it's framework.

`Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9` works only with SSL.
