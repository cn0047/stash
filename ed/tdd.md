````
Stub    - an object that provides predefined answers to method calls.
Mock    - an object on which you set expectations.
Fixture - is the fixed state that exists at the start of a test.

<ul>
    <li><b>Acceptance</b>: Does the whole system work?</li>
    <li><b>Integration</b>: Does our code work against code we can't change?</li>
    <li><b>Unit</b>: Do our objects do the right thing, are they convenient to work with?</li>
</ul>

In each test should be just one assert.
