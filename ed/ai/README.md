Artificial Intelligence
-

Machine learning (ML) - perform task without using explicit instructions (relying on patterns).
Deep Learning - subfield of ML.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) - systems "learn" to perform tasks
by considering examples, generally without being programmed with task-specific rules.
Computer vision - deals with understanding from digital images or videos.
Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) - .
Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) - .

Supervised learning - when we have info, like cat is on picture.
(email spam/not spam, cancer tumor).
Unsupervised learning - no info.
(database of custome data (market segments), news.google.com articles).
Reinforcement learning.

Dataset must be divided into: train, validation, test.

Classic Problems:
* Classification (supervised learning).
* Regression (supervised learning).
* Clustering (unsupervised learning).
* Density.
* Sampling.
* Reinforcement Learning.
