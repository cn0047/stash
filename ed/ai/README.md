Artificial Intelligence
-

CUDA - Nvidia's parallel computing platform and programming model for GPUs.
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='0,1'` - use devices 0,1
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=''` - don't use any device
`CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1`

Computer vision - deals with understanding from digital images or videos.

Optical flow (needed for object tracking) - the pattern of apparent motion of image objects
between two consecutive frames caused by the movemement of object or camera.

Data mining - process of discovering patterns in large data sets.

Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP).

Optimal Brain Damage (OBD).

Large Language Model (LLM) -  ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Gemini, Meta Llama.

GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) - autoregressive language model
that uses DL to produce human-like text.

Gen AI - generates new data that mirrors the training set.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) - standard to streamline & standardize how LLMs interact with external tools, systems, etc.

Agentic AI - system which can plan, decide and act,
based on understanding of environment, constraints, and desired outcomes.
Examples: autonomous vehicles, robotic process automation, game-playing AI, etc.
Concerns: safety, ethics, control.

Non-Agentic AI (passive AI) - provides outputs or predictions in response to inputs,
without taking further actions.
Examples: ML model predicting house prices - just predict without any action.
