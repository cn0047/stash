NLP - Neuro-linguistic programming.
OBD - Optimal Brain Damage.
Machine learning - perform task without using explicit instructions (relying on patterns).

Unsupervised learning - no info.
(database of custome data (market segments), news.google.com articles).
Reinforcement learning.

Dataset must be divided into: train, validation, test.

Classic Problems:
* Classification (supervised learning).
* Regression (supervised learning).
* Clustering (unsupervised learning).
* Density.
