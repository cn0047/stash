REST (Representational State Transfer)
-

Properties:
* Performance (Servers and clients may be replaced and developed independently).
* Scalability to support large numbers of components.
* Simplicity of interfaces.
* Stateless (RESTful APIs).
* Cacheable.
* Uniform interface.
* etc...

The fundamental concept in any RESTful API is the resource.
It is similar to an object instance in an object-oriented programming language.

Resources can be grouped into collections.
Each collection is homogeneous so that it contains only one type of resource.

The following representations are common for resources:
* json
* yaml
* xml
* html

| Type | Content-Type                  |
|------|-------------------------------|
| JSON | application/x-resource+json   |
|      | application/x-collection+json |

URLs generated by the API should be absolute URLs.

Good:
````
/users/12345
/customers/33245/orders/8769/lineitems/1
````

|   | name     | description                               |
|---|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| ● | GET      |                                           |
|   | HEAD     | like get but return header only           |
| ● | POST     | create                                    |
| ● | PUT      | update (if it does not exist, create it.) |
|   | PATCH    | update                                    |
| ● | DELETE   |                                           |
|   | OPTIONS  | return available HTTP methods             |

PATCH applies a delta rather than (PUT) replacing the entire resource.
PUT method body contains entire entity.
PATCH method body describes modifications to be made to a resource.

The PUT and DELETE methods are referred to as idempotent,
meaning that the operation will produce the same result no matter how many times it is repeated.
The GET method is a safe method (or nullipotent), meaning that calling it produces no side-effects.

Pagination:
````
GET /api/collection
Range: resources=100-199 # in body

curl 'http://localhost:8080/v1/api/collection' -XGET -d '{"resources_from":100, "resources_to":199}'
````

For security it's better to return JSON with an Object on the outside:
<br>not: `[{"object": "inside an array"}]`
<br>but: `{"result": [{"object": "inside an array"}]}`
