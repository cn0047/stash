REST (Representational State Transfer)
-

Properties:
* Performance (Servers and clients may be replaced and developed independently).
* Scalability to support large numbers of components.
* Simplicity of interfaces.
* Stateless (RESTful APIs).
* Cacheable.
* Uniform interface.
* etc...

The fundamental concept in any RESTful API is the resource.
It is similar to an object instance in an object-oriented programming language.

Resources can be grouped into collections.
Each collection is homogeneous so that it contains only one type of resource.

The following representations are common for resources:
* json
* yaml
* xml
* html

| Type | Content-Type                  |
|------|-------------------------------|
| JSON | application/x-resource+json   |
|      | application/x-collection+json |

URLs generated by the API should be absolute URLs.

Good:
````
/users/12345
/customers/33245/orders/8769/lineitems/1
````

|   | name     | description                               |
|---|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| ● | GET      |                                           |
|   | HEAD     | like get but return header only           |
| ● | POST     | create                                    |
| ● | PUT      | update (if it does not exist, create it.) |
|   | PATCH    | update                                    |
| ● | DELETE   |                                           |
|   | OPTIONS  | return available HTTP methods             |

PATCH applies a delta rather than (PUT) replacing the entire resource.
PUT method body contains entire entity.
PATCH method body describes modifications to be made to a resource.

The PUT and DELETE methods are referred to as idempotent,
meaning that the operation will produce the same result no matter how many times it is repeated.
The GET method is a safe method (or nullipotent), meaning that calling it produces no side-effects.

| code             | desc                                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 201 Created      | successful creation occurred (via either POST or PUT)  |
| 202 Accepted     | should only be returned for POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE |
| 204 No Content   | Often used for DELETE and PUT                          |
| 400 Bad Request  |                                                        |
| 401 Unauthorized | missing or invalid authentication token                |
| 403 Forbidden    | user is not authorized                                 |

| method | success                | fail                                                                    |

| GET    | 200 OK                 | 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found                                          |
| POST   | 201 Created            | 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 409 Conflict if resource already exists |
| PUT    | 200 OK, 204 No Content | 404 Not Found                                                           |
| DELETE | 200 OK                 | 404 Not Found                                                           |
