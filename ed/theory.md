#### Programming:

Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.
Imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform.

Declarative programming focuses on what the program should accomplish
without specifying how the program should achieve the result.

#### Extreme Programming:

Core Practices:
* Whole Team
* Planning Game
<br>*Release Planning*
<br>*Iteration Planning*
* Customer Tests
* Small Releases
* Simple Design
* Pair Programming
* Test-Driven Development
* Design Improvement
<br>*Refactoring*
* Continuous Integration
* Collective Code Ownership
* Coding Standard
* Metaphor
<br>*(common vision of how the program works)*
* Sustainable Pace

#### Agile:

The Agile Manifesto is based on 12 principles:

1.  Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software
2.  Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3.  Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
4.  Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5.  Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6.  Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7.  Working software is the principal measure of progress
8.  Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11. Self-organizing teams
11. Regular adaptation to changing circumstance
