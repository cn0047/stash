Agile
-

#### Waterfall

Originated in the manufacturing and construction industries.
If the fact changes - it's impossible or at least prohibitively expensive to adapt to changes.

Phases:

conception -> initiation -> analysis -> design -> construction -> testing -> deployment -> maintenance

conception, initiation = 20–40% of the time invested
coding = 30–40%
rest = rest

#### Agile

The Agile Manifesto is based on 12 principles:

1.  Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software
2.  **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development**
3.  Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
4.  Close, **daily cooperation between business people and developers**
5.  **Projects are built around motivated individuals**, who should be trusted
6.  **Face-to-face conversation** is the best form of communication (co-location)
7.  Working software is the principal measure of progress
8.  Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11. **Self-organizing teams**
11. **Regular adaptation to changing circumstance**

Agile software development methods:

* Adaptive software development (ASD)
* Agile modeling
* Agile Unified Process (AUP)
* Crystal Clear Methods
* Disciplined agile delivery
* Dynamic systems development method (DSDM)
* **Extreme programming** (XP)
* Feature-driven development (FDD)
* Lean software development
* **Kanban** (development)
* **Scrum**
* Scrum ban

Agile practices:

* Acceptance test-driven development (**ATDD**)
* Agile modeling
* Backlogs (Product and Sprint)
* Behavior-driven development (**BDD**)
* Cross-functional team
* Continuous integration (**CI**)
* Domain-driven design (**DDD**)
* Information radiators (scrum board, task board, visual management board, burndown chart)
* Iterative and incremental development (**IID**)
* **Pair programming**
* Planning poker
* Refactoring
* **Scrum events**
* Test-driven development (**TDD**)
* Agile testing
* Timeboxing
* Use case
* User story
* Story-driven modeling
* Retrospective
* **Velocity tracking**

#### Extreme Programming:

Core Practices:
* Whole Team
* Planning Game
<br>*Release Planning*
<br>*Iteration Planning*
* Customer Tests
* Small Releases
* Simple Design
* Pair Programming
* Test-Driven Development
* Design Improvement
<br>*Refactoring*
* Continuous Integration
* Collective Code Ownership
* Coding Standard
* Metaphor
<br>*(common vision of how the program works)*
* Sustainable Pace

#### Kanban

Method for visualizing the flow of work,
in order to balance demand with available capacity and spot bottlenecks.

Kanban focuses on the customer and work which meets their needs.

General practices:
* visualization
* limiting work in progress
* flow management
* making policies explicit
* using feedback loops
* collaborative or experimental evolution

#### Crystal Clear Methods

* Frequent delivery.
* Reflective improvement.
* Close or osmotic communication.
  Osmotic communication - the team must be in the same room for this to work.
* Personal safety.
  People in team polite and calm anyone can ask any stupid question.
* Focus:
  1. Two-hour period where the developer is to have no interruptions, meetings, long questions, phone call, etc.
  2. definition of goals should be clear.
* Easy access to expert users.
* Technical environment with automated tests, configuration management, and frequent integration.

#### Scrum

Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development framework
for managing product development.

Roles:

* Product Owner
* Scrum Master
* Development Team

Events:

* sprint planning (planning poker)
* grooming (backlog refinement)
* daily scrum
* demo
* sprint review and retrospective

Artifacts:

* Product backlog
* Management (prioritize product backlog items)
* Sprint backlog
* Product increment (product backlog items completed during a sprint)
* Extensions
  * Sprint burn-down chart
  * Release burn-up chart
  * Definition of done (DoD)
  * Velocity

Limitations:
Scrum works less well in the following circumstances:

Teams whose members are geographically dispersed or part-time
Teams whose members have very specialized skills
Products with many external dependencies
Products that are mature or legacy or with regulated quality control

#### Adaptive software development

Continuous learning and adaptation to the emergent state of the project.
The characteristics of an ASD life cycle are that it is:

* mission focused
* feature based
* iterative
* timeboxed
* risk driven
* change tolerant
